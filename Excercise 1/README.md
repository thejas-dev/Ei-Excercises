# Exercise 1

## Introduction

Welcome to Exercise 1 of the Ei Programming Exercises repository. This section demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns through practical use cases. The exercises are divided into three main categories: Behavioral Patterns, Creational Patterns, and Structural Patterns.

## Problem Statement
Come up creatively with six different use cases to demonstrate your understanding of the following software design patterns by coding the
same.
1. Two use cases to demonstrate two behavioural design pattern.
2. Two use cases to demonstrate two creational design pattern.
3. Two use cases to demonstrate two structural design pattern.

## Behavioral Pattern

### Observer Pattern

**Definition**: The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.


### State Pattern

**Definition**: The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.


## Creational Pattern

### Factory Method Pattern

**Definition**: The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.


### Singleton Pattern

**Definition**: The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.


## Structural Pattern

### Decorator Pattern

**Definition**: The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Proxy Pattern

**Definition**: The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

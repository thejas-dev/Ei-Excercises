## About the project 
ChatApp is a terminal-based `real-time` chat application designed for communication within a network or on a local machine. 

Developed using `TypeScript`, this project features both a server and a client component. The server is built with Node.js and leverages the `WebSocket protocol` using the "ws" library to facilitate real-time, bidirectional communication. 

On the client side, `TypeScript` is used in conjunction with the `readline` library to handle user input and interact with the chat server.
